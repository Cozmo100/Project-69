At his grandfather's house, three hundred miles away from home, Peter knows he isn't where he should be—with Pax. He strikes out on his own despite the encroaching war, spurred by love, loyalty, and grief, to be reunited with his fox.

		  <p>Percy Jackson is just a normal twelve year old boy. Sure he's got problems with school, bullies, and authority but at that age who doesn't?  Getting kicked out of school after school does have a way of making one think he's a screw up though.  One day though on a seemingly innocent visit to the beach with his mother Percy's life changes forever.  Finding out his best friends is a satyr and being chased by the Minotaur into a camp for demigods is only the beginning of Percy Jackson's new life.  Here he makes friends with children of similar parentage and finally finds himself a place where he belongs.

Peace can only last for so long though once it is discovered which god has fathered Percy.  Monstrous attacks begin and Percy is sent on a quest to retrieve Zeus's stolen master bolt (the lightening bolt from which all other bolts are made) and return it before the summer solstice to stop an all out war between the gods.  Along the way is more adventure than one boy can handle danger at every turn, and new heights of treachery.
